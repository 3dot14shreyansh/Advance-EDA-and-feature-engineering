# Advance-EDA-and-feature-engineering
This projects aims to clean and correct the raw data. <br />
Please find the raw data by clicking 
[datasheet here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
We have taken a dataset which is as raw as it can be possible. The idea to do such EDA project is to demostrate on how to handle a raw datsheet and ways of exploring data aswell as understaning data using charts.

### EDA 1: <br />

 - With the help of 
 [numpy](https://numpy.org) 
 [Python3](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/difference-between-python-2-and-3/) 
 library, the code blocks aims generate a list of feature  and find out percentages of missing value in a column.

- Wih the help of list of features which have feature names of missing value is plotted against the dependent / target feature ('SalePrice') so as to get an idea of how many colums have strong relations with dependent feature. This will eventually help us to underatsnd the need of retaining the while putting it into any ML model

- Similary we segregated numerical feture and all year based feature column.
 
 - With the help of [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) 
 and 
 [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
 , we plotted few graphs for better understanding.
